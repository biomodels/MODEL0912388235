**Abstract:**   
A model of the rabbit sinoatrial action potential is introduced, based on a
model by Morris & Lecar. One cell is described by two nonlinear first-order
ordinary differential equations, with ten constant parameters. The model is
much simpler than most other models in use, but can reproduce perfectly
experimentally recorded action potentials. The dynamics of two coupled cells,
with and without the presence of periodic acetylcholine pulses, shows examples
of bifurcations and strange attractors, mathematical phenomena characterizing
chaotic motion. It remains to be clarified whether such dynamics is actually
observed, for example in the small irregular variations of the normal heart
rate.
